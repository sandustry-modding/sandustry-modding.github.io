# Integration tests

Node helpers for tests that talk to the **extracted game** in Chromium.
Import from `*.integration.test.ts` only.

```ts
import test from "node:test";
import { expect, setupGame } from "@modkit/test";

const game = await setupGame();

test("a", async () => {
  await game.evaluate(() => sandkit.api.player.getPositionAtWorld());
});

test("void world", async () => {
  await expect(game).toHaveScreenshot("void-world.png");
});
```

`setupGame()` connects once per test file.
Later calls in that file reuse the session.
The file closes the CDP socket when it finishes so the Node test worker can exit.

`npm test` runs **unit** files only (`*.test.ts`, not `*.integration.test.ts`).
It does not start Chromium.

`npm run test:integration`:

1. Builds `src/` with `--debug` into `dist/`.
  Builds `examples/` too when that folder is present (or when you pass `--examples`, which clones [SandustryExamples](https://github.com/sandustry-modding/SandustryExamples)).
2. Boots `sandustry/source/dist` in headless Chromium (CDP **:9224**).
3. Waits for boot to finish (`game:ready`, `#loading` removed, Game scene).
4. Runs every `*.integration.test.ts` with `--test-concurrency=1` (async spawn so
   the host HTTP server keeps serving `/mods/...` during the run).

Use **`npm run test:integration:view`** to open a visible Chrome window instead of headless.
That script passes `--view` to the runner.
On Linux it needs `DISPLAY`.

### Performance

The host is heavy: it boots the full game in Chromium with sim workers and WebGL.
To reduce lag on your machine (and on Steam Sandustry):

| Goal                        | Command                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Run one mod only            | `nr test:integration template`               |
| Run one mod with a window   | `nr test:integration:view collector-element` |
| Run example samples only    | `nr test:integration --examples`             |
| Skip the full example build | pass a mod folder (or `--mod`)               |

Local runs:

- Use the GPU (SwiftShader only in `CI`, for screenshot baselines).
- Cap `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` at 4 so vanilla spawns about **2** sim workers (not ~`cores − 2`).
- Launch Chrome under `nice -n 10` and limit raster / renderer processes.
- Allow Chrome timer throttling (full frame-rate flags stay on in CI only).
- Pause the sim after boot until a test needs live frames.

Pass a mod folder name (or `--mod <folder>`) to build that mod, load only that
mod in the host, and run only its integration tests.
Repeat folders / `--mod`
to select several. Pass `--examples` to build every sample and run only
`examples/**/*.integration.test.ts`.

```bash
nr test:integration:view overlay-hotkey
nr test:integration template
nr test:integration overlay-hotkey i18n
nr test:integration --examples
```

If the host is not running, `setupGame()` throws.
Run integration files only through `npm run test:integration`.

When the tests finish, the host stops.
Do not open Chrome DevTools on that window while the tests run.
That steals CDP from the runner.

This host does not attach to Steam or F5, and it does not stop them.

It copies every built mod from `dist/` (then fills gaps from the OS mods folder) and enables them. `--mod` copies only those mods.
It loads the tracked Void save `modkit/test/fixtures/Empty.save` with `?db_load=<meta.id>` (vanilla file name is `{id}.save`).
A harness mod sets `globalThis.sandkit`.
Dev-tools can fetch `main.js` from `/mods/<id>/`.
Vanilla HUD textures stay at `/mods/<file>.png` from extracted `dist/mods/`.
The host rewrites the served `js/bundle.js` so `assets.getUrl` / map blueprints accept HTTP `rootUrl` (vanilla join allows `file:` only). `sessionStorage.splashShown` is set; `?db_load=` still runs vanilla shader wait.

Import `@modkit/test` from test files only.
The esbuild alias rejects a game bundle import.
The module also throws if `document` exists.

`npm test` strips types.
Assign constructor arguments to fields in the constructor body.
Use `import type` for type-only imports.

Name integration files `*.integration.test.ts` (for example `src/template/template.integration.test.ts`).

Tests that write the same world (for example player position) must run in order.
Use `describe(..., { concurrency: false }, () => { ... })`.

## Session

| Call                                 | Role                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `game.evaluate(fn, ...args)`         | Run `fn` in the renderer. Arguments must be JSON values. Closures do not capture Node locals. |
| `game.waitFor(read, match, options)` | Poll `read` in the page until `match` is true in Node.                                        |
| `game.buildStructures(placements)`   | Build several structures in one renderer turn and wait for every anchor.                      |
| `game.buildLayout(layout)`           | Expand a visual fixture diagram into phased structure placements.                             |
| `game.setSimulationPaused(paused)`   | Pause or resume the simulation without opening the in-game pause menu.                        |
| `game.pauseSimulation()`             | Pause the simulation.                                                                         |
| `game.resumeSimulation()`            | Resume the simulation.                                                                        |
| `game.runSimulation(durationMs)`     | Run live simulation for a wall-clock duration, then restore the prior pause state.            |
| `game.orderedModIds()`               | Return live `manifest.id` values from the ordered mod list.                                   |
| `game.screenshot(options)`           | Capture a PNG of the compositor (WebGL plus DOM). Returns a `Buffer`.                         |
| `game.withModMain(id, fn)`           | Edit the test-host `main.js`, then restore the original bytes.                                |
| `game.tryReadModMain(id)`            | Return the test-host bundle, or `null`.                                                       |

`waitFor` defaults: 8000 ms timeout, 250 ms interval.

Return values from `evaluate` must be JSON-serializable.

### Structure fixtures

`game.buildStructures(placements)` builds a batch of structures and waits for
their anchors to appear.
Each placement uses cell coordinates and can include
`options` or seeded `data`.
Seeded data is applied after the structure anchor
exists, which makes it reliable for custom structure initialization.

The helper resumes the simulation while building, then restores its previous
pause state.
An empty placement list is a no-op.

For fixtures that are easier to understand as a diagram, use
`game.buildLayout()`.
Each character represents one structure on a 4-cell
grid; `.` leaves a cell empty:

```ts
await game.buildLayout({
  origin: { x: 2400, y: 1612 },
  cells: ["fff", "fsf", "fff"],
  legend: {
    f: { type: "foundation" },
    s: { type: "mySource", data: { mode: "sand" } },
  },
});
```

Use `phases` when placement order matters.
Every phase is expanded and built
before the next phase begins:

```ts
await game.buildLayout({
  origin: { x: 2400, y: 1612 },
  phases: [
    {
      cells: ["fff", "f.f", "fff"],
      legend: { f: { type: "foundation" } },
    },
    {
      cells: ["...", ".s.", "..."],
      legend: { s: { type: "mySource" } },
    },
  ],
});
```

The top-left character is placed at `origin`; columns and rows add four cells
per step.
Use either top-level `cells` and `legend`, or `phases`, but not both.

### Simulation control

The integration host starts with the simulation paused.
Use
`runSimulation()` for a bounded behavior check; it resumes the simulation for
the requested wall-clock duration and restores the state afterward:

```ts
await game.runSimulation(1000);
```

For longer workflows, use `resumeSimulation()` and `pauseSimulation()`
explicitly. `setSimulationPaused(value)` is useful when a test needs to
restore or assert a specific state.
These helpers change the engine session
state directly and do not open the game’s pause menu.

## Screenshots

`expect(game).toHaveScreenshot(name)` captures, then compares against a PNG next to the test file. `expect(png).toMatchSnapshot(name)` compares a buffer you already captured.
Value checks stay on `node:assert`.

| Item             | Value                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline folder  | `<file>.integration.test.ts-snapshots/`                  |
| File name        | `{name}-chromium-{platform}.png`                         |
| Fail artifacts   | `.tmp/sandustry-test-screenshots/`                       |
| Update baselines | `npm run test:integration -- --test-update-snapshots`    |
| Missing snapshot | Write the PNG, then fail. In `CI`, fail without a write. |
| Retry            | Same as `waitFor`: 8000 ms timeout, 250 ms interval      |

Capture options:

| Option       | Role                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `clip`       | CSS-pixel rectangle                            |
| `selector`   | Clip to a DOM node (`getBoundingClientRect`)   |
| `mask`       | CSS selectors painted `#FF00FF` before capture |
| `path`       | Write the PNG to that path                     |
| `animations` | `"disabled"` (default) or `"allow"`            |

Compare options: `maxDiffPixels`, `maxDiffPixelRatio`, `threshold` (default `0.2`).

Game rules:

- The host uses SwiftShader only in CI so PNG baselines match across machines.
  Local runs prefer the GPU.
- The test page reports `hardwareConcurrency` as 4 so vanilla keeps about two sim workers.
- Chrome launches under `nice -n 10` (Unix) with fewer raster threads.
- After boot the host pauses the sim (`session.paused`) until a test needs live frames.
- `animations: "disabled"` pauses the sim (`session.paused`), then waits on a short timer.
  It does not open the pause menu.
  It does not use `requestAnimationFrame` (pause can
  stop the page frame loop and hang CDP).
- Prefer `selector` or `mask` for HUD clocks and other live UI.
